# Movie_Rating_Analysis
This project explores the relationship between movie features and viewer ratings using Python in Google Colab. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights into how factors like genre, year, duration, and vote count affect IMDb ratings.

Key Analysis Areas
- Rating distribution across years and genres
- Correlation between **runtime, vote count, and ratings**
- Identification of **top-rated genres** and underperforming categories
- Outlier detection (e.g., extremely long or short movies)
- Heatmap analysis of numeric features

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (optional for interactive plots)
